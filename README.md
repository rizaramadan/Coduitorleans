> ### [Microsoft Orleans](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Microsoft Orleans](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [Microsoft Orleans](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/) community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# Getting Started
to have this up and running, steps are as follow:
1. clone this repository
2. prepare the database, as instructed in [/scripts/README.md](https://github.com/rizaramadan/Conduitorleans/blob/main/scripts/README.md)
3. build the solution
4. start [/src/SiloHost](https://github.com/rizaramadan/Conduitorleans/tree/main/src/SiloHost) project first, after its up and running
5. start the [/src/Conduit](https://github.com/rizaramadan/Conduitorleans/tree/main/src/Conduit)

### Footnote
Copy many codes from [an awesome conduit implementation using ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/gothinkster/aspnetcore-realworld-example-app).
Please check that repository, many things done right and much to learn from it.
